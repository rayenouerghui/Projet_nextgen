🚀 Project Showcase: NextGen - A Gaming E-Commerce Platform with Real-Time Delivery Tracking

I'm thrilled to share a project I've been working on - NextGen, a full-stack gaming e-commerce platform that combines modern web technologies with an immersive gaming aesthetic.

🎯 What is NextGen?

NextGen is a complete e-commerce solution for digital games, featuring:
• A beautiful game catalogue with video previews
• User authentication and profile management
• Shopping cart and credits system
• Real-time GPS delivery tracking
• Admin dashboard for complete platform management

💡 Key Technical Highlights:

1️⃣ Real-Time Delivery Tracking
The standout feature is the GPS tracking system. When an admin confirms a delivery, users can watch their order travel in real-time on an interactive map. I integrated:
• MapLibre GL JS for smooth map rendering
• OSRM API for actual road route calculations
• Custom animations for the delivery truck marker
• Progress bar showing delivery stages

2️⃣ Modern UI/UX Design
I built a complete design system from scratch featuring:
• Gaming-themed purple/pink gradients
• Glassmorphism card effects
• Smooth animations and transitions
• Responsive design for all devices
• Custom scrollbars and hover effects

3️⃣ Clean Architecture
The backend follows MVC pattern with:
• Separate controllers for each module
• Model classes with proper encapsulation
• Service layer for business logic
• RESTful API endpoints

🛠️ Tech Stack:
• Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6+
• Backend: PHP 8.2
• Database: MySQL/MariaDB
• Maps: MapLibre GL JS, Leaflet, OSRM
• Styling: Custom Design System

📚 What I Learned:
• Integrating mapping APIs and handling geolocation
• Building real-time features without WebSockets
• Creating a cohesive design system
• Managing complex state across multiple pages
• Admin workflow design and implementation

🎮 Bonus: The platform includes 8 playable HTML5 games!

This project pushed me to combine multiple technologies and think about user experience at every step. The delivery tracking feature alone taught me so much about working with geographic data and creating engaging visualizations.

Would love to hear your thoughts! What features would you add to a platform like this?
